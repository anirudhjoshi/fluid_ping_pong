This is a demonstration of the possibilites that HTML5/browsers have to offer.

#### Introduction ####

It renders a ping pong game interacting with a full color real-time fluid simulation at 60 FPS using the algorithim created by Jos Stam (Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games), implemented by Oliver Hunt (Oliver's simple fluid dynamics simulator), aided by RJ Marsan's RGB example and a little bit of special sauce from me.

For those of whom don't understand why this is impressive: It just is (thanks to the great work done by the Chrome and Mozilla teams :).

It has been tested to work with the latest versions of Chrome/Firefox.
