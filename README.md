#### Ping pong with fluid dynamics ####

This is a demonstration of the possibilites that HTML5/browsers have to offer.

#### Introduction ####

It renders a ping pong game interacting with a full color real-time fluid simulation at 60 FPS using the algorithim created by Jos Stam (Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games), implemented by Oliver Hunt (Oliver's simple fluid dynamics simulator), aided by RJ Marsan's RGB example and a little bit of special sauce from me.

For those of whom don't understand why this is impressive: It just is.

This is possible mainly due to the wonderful work done by both the Chrome and Mozilla teams.

It has been tested to work with the latest versions of Chrome/Firefox.
